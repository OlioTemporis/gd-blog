The Tetrahedron (Solid Triangle, Pyramid of Fire) is the admission badge to the Path of Shin and the symbol for Fire, representing its simple nature and its Latent or Hidden side (via the hollow within or the fourth triangle hidden from view). The three upper triangles represent Solar Fire, Volcanic Fire, and Astral Fire, while the fourth and basal triangle represents latent heat. Active Fire is AUD, passive fire is AUB, equilibrated Fire is AUR, while name of Fire itself is אש ASh (CCCI). Therefore the Tetrahedron may be related to the glyph of the Caduceus, as it also reflects these three fires (pingala + ida + shushumna) rising in unison.

In the Golden Dawn Tarot, the Pyramid of Fire is used for the Queen of the Thrones of Flame: "The head of the wand, which she holds, resembles a type of Yod while the sigil of the scale which is repeated on the Wand, throne, belt, knee armour and neck broach is the pyramid of Fire, as viewed from different angles and is a symbol of the Tejas
Tattwa. On her crown and on the uprights of her throne, the pyramid of Fire is repeated with the upturned Water pyramid beneath it, to modify its temperament. The combination of these two pyramids is depicted as the symbol of the scale. As a Queen of the Salamanders, her function is to modify and direct the commands given to her by the knight and to temper them if need be." (_The Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn_, Zalewski, pg. 224)

In a sense, this image does reflect the job of the Practicus who has to balance the fiery path of Shin with his current watery temperament (the element of the Practicus grade, Stolistis, and Hod).

According to Grant in _Cults of the Shadow_, the following associations are made with AVD, AVB, and AVR:

- אוד AVD (XI, eleven being the number of the magick) is written as 'od' and means 'firebrand' or 'a three-pronged fork', i.e. the trident of Neptune ש.
- אוב AVB (IX, nine being the number of the Lunar current) is written as 'ob' and means 'spirit, familiar' or 'medium, sorceror'. Massey associates it to 'au' meaning to flow or bleed, thereby indicating serpentine movement. The Witch of Endor is described as having knowledge of AVB, i.e. the serpent. Therefore in this vein the pythonesses may be considered.
- אור AVR (CCVII), written as 'auor' and means 'light', specifically the Magick Light, the currents of the Fire Snake in harmony rising through the Middle Pillar. Hence AVD is the solar (pingala) current and AVB the lunar (ida) current.

Other symbols in Practicus:

- **The Greek Cross of thirteen Squares** = admission badge to the Path of Resh
- **The Cup of Stolistes** = admission badge (also the Lamen for Stolistes) to Water Temple of Hod
- The symbolism of the Cup of Stolistes, Mercury, and the Caduceus applied to the Tree of Life.
- **The Garden of Eden before the Fall** - this is the first color insert in Greer's edition of the GD material. The diagram of Eden before the Fall is a pictorial embodiment of the three basic principles in humanity; the three Qabalistic parts of the Soul; the Age of Innocence; the Golden Age: An early evolutionary stage in the history of the human race is symbolized here (a time when humans were not sentient beings) there was no such thing as self-consciousness. The woman at the top is the Neshamah, contrasted by Eve at the bottom as the Nephesh. At the center is Adam, the sleeping Ruach.
- Aima Elohim, the Mother Supernal, as the Woman of the Apocalpyse clothed with the Sun, the Moon under her feet, and on her head the Crown of Twelve Stars = magical image for the Three Supernal Sephiroth. Do I need to point out that the Aima Elohim is one being depicted at the top of the 'The Garden of Eden before the Fall'
- Proceeding from below Malkuth is the Tree of Daath, which is between the Etz Chaim and the Assiah, the World of Shells, represented by a coiled up dragon with seven heads (the Seven Infernal Palaces) and ten horns (the Ten Averse Sephiroth)
- this dragon is also the great Arcanum, neither good nor evil in itself, but of tremendous value
- The Rivers of Eden forming a Cross

Finally, make sure you study the 20th and 19th Trumps and the symbolism contained therein. Build yourself a memory palace of these two places and go to visualization town on a daily basis. The more you visualize these things, the more of a chance they have to affect you.
