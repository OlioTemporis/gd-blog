_The Arbatel of Magic_ dates to 1575 and originally had nine sections. Most of these have been lost, leaving only the introduction in tact. Interestingly enough, the author focuses on pagan Greek magic rather than the Judaic one. The author believed that the greatest magical teacher is an Angelic teacher sent from the Nous.

The book states that there are seven Olympic spirits who rule over 196 divisions of heaven. Each one rules for a period of 490 years. It is believed that Ophiel (Mercury) is the one who rules today, his rule having started in 1900.

Finally, although their names and sigils are given, they have no power unless paired to the correct divine name, which is given by the Spirits, and even then this divine name changes every 40 years.

- Saturn = Aratron
- Jupiter = Bethor (ruled 60 BC - 430 AD)
- Mars = Phalegh (430 AD - 920 AD)
- Sol = Och (920 AD - 1410 AD)
- Venus = Hagith (1410 AD - 1900 AD)
- Ophiel = Mercury (1900 AD - 2390 AD)
- Phul = Luna

Although the method for evocation is not given in this knowledge lecture, here is a brief outline of how it would be done. For this example, we will use Phul, who is described as a watery spirit, therefore since we need a water spirit (let's say to consecrate a talisman for calirvoyance), we need to evok Phul in order to command one to do this.

1. Decorate both the physical and astral temple according to the correspondences of Luna, e.g. nine silver candles, for incense camphor or aloes, for stones crystals and pearls and moonstones, a statue of a dog or stork or camel, etc
2. Perform an LBRP to cleanse the space and then a MP to increase your energy
3. Perform a Luna Hexagram invocation ritual (must be on the hour of Luna, and is further made effective on the day of Luna)
4. Go through the hierarchy of divine names associated to Luna and then evoke Phul using his sigil as an astral gateway
5. Once the interaction is over, LBRP and close the temple.
