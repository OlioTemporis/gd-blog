The Literal Qabalah is about the connection between the numbers and letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It exists primarily in three forms: Gematria, Notariqon, and Temurah.

- **Gematria** - the method by which one finds connections between words and phrases by adding up the numerical values of its letters, e.g. RVCh ALHIM = 300 = the letter Shin, therefore Shin is a symbol for the Holy Spirit.
- **Aiq Beker** - the method by which one converts letters into numbers and allows one to trace out sigils on Qameoth.
- **Notariqon** - the method by which one expands or contracts a phrase, e.g. I.N.R.I. = Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum.
- **Temurah** - the method by which one can create a cipher by moving around letters. For example, _Thashrag_ is one of the forms of permutations (Temurah) that may be employed. It consists of writing your words backwards, e.g. uoy era woh, olleH?
