Just as each Sephira/Planet has its own system of corresponding energies in plants, minerals, colors, sounds, etc., they also have their corresponding number and shape

- Saturn = 3 = triangle (if black, it means Saturn; if red, Fire)
- Jupiter = 4 = square
- Mars = 5 = pentagram
- Sol = 6 = hexagram
- Venus = 7 = heptagram (And as the Heptagram is the lineal figure of the Seven Planets, so is Venus as it were their Gate or entrance, the fitting symbol of the Isis of Nature, and of the seven lower Sephiroth of the Bride.)
- Mercury = 8 = octagram (fitly representing the Triad operating in each element in its dual form, i.e., of Positive and Negative)
- Luna = 9 = enneagram (the Star of Luna, and is especially applicable to her nature. It represents her as the administratrix to the Earth of the virtues of the Solar System under the Sephiroth.)

Note: the Rhombus is related to the Vesica Piscis, which was commonly used to enclose holy figures.

- the point within the circle = Kether
- the cross within the circle = Chokmah
- the triangle within the circle = Binah
- the square within the circle = Chesed

## Magic Squares (Qameoth)

</figure>

Qameoth is a Hebrew word for talisman or amulet and they are diagrams and potent mystical pentacles for a specific planet. Although these were published by Agrippa, some scholars believe their origin to be ancient and Persian.

Within these dwell the archangels, intelligences, and spirits specific to that planet, and you may use it to create sigils for them. You can also derive its planetary seal from them.

In the GD system, creating talismans was originally for the Adepts but now with all this published material, you can do it yourself without waiting. Note: there are disagreements relating to correspondences, even in the same systems. Therefore, choose one and stick with it.
