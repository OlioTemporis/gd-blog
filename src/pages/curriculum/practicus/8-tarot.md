Know how Tarot relates to the Qabalah (in this instance DuQuette's _Tarot Architect_ is an excellent primer), the main meaning of the cards individually, and the various attributions.

In the opinion of some modern occultists, Geomancy (and the I-Ching) are far more transperent with their meaning, given that in Tarot the interpretation is given a wider scope, since both geomancy and the I-Ching work on a binary yes/no system.

As noted by GD with aligning the 16 court cards with the 16 geomantic figures, which Crowley extended to 16 Hexagrams from the I Ching, try out some experiements: e.g. do a geomantic reading with the court cards instead of with a coin/dice.

To extend the example, take your court cards outside with you outside (geomancy works best when it isn't raining or some other natural storm is taking place), invoke the earth element and spirits to aid you, toss your consecrated coin, even = 2 dots, odd = 1 dot, do this four times for the figure and then repeat again eleven times for a total of 12 houses.

A more direct form of dealing with spirits to do divination would be to evoke them and ask. But the quality of the divination will depend much upon the quality of the spirit being worked with, if the spirit has a speciality in a divination and for that specific type of divination (e.g. a spirit who specializes in divination about politics), your personal connection to said spirit, and the potency of your evocation.

Finally, you could also use bibliomancy, as it is done with the I-Ching or with Virgil's work during the medieval period.
