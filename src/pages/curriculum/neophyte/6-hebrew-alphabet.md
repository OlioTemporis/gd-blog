According to the Qabalah, God brought forth Creation with the aid of these twenty-two letters. At this stage, all you have to memorize is the alphabet, the literal meanings of the names (e.g. 'aleph' means both the letter and 'ox' or 'bull'), and its numerical value.

Make sure you start practicing by finding the enumerations of Hebrew words as you come across them to develop all of these skills together.

1. א Aleph, 1, 'ox'
2. ב Beth, 2, 'domus'
3. ג Gimel, 3, 'camel'
4. ד Daleth, 4, 'door'
5. ה Heh, 5, 'window'
6. ו Vav, 6, 'nail'
7. ז Zayin, 7, 'gladius'
8. ח Cheth, 8, 'fence', 'enclosure'
9. ט Teth, 9, 'ophis'
10. י Yod, 10, 'hand'
11. כ Kaph, 20 / ך 500, 'a hand in the action of taking something'
12. ל Lamed, 30, 'stimulus'
13. מ Mem, 40 / ם 600, 'aqua'
14. נ Nun, 50 / ן 700, 'piscis'
15. ס Samekh, 60, 'prop'
16. ע Ayin, 70, 'oculus'
17. פ Peh, 80 / ף 800, 'os'
18. צ Tzaddi, 90 / ץ 900, 'fish-hook'
19. ק Qoph, 100, 'back of head'
20. ר Resh, 200, 'front of head'
21. ש Shin, 300, 'tooth'
22. ת Tau, 400, 'cross'

NOTE: You are free to use or not use the numerical values of final letters. Frater Perdurabo, for example, would add entries for both, e.g. אדם ADM (adam, ἄνθρωπος) may either be 1 + 4 + 40 = 45, or 1 + 4 + 600 = 605.
