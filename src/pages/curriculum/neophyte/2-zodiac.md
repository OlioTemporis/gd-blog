pubDate: 2026-02-01
description: "A lecture on the Zodiac. Pictured above is the Greek Cross, the symbol presented before Sandalphon to gain entry into Malkuth during pathworking. In the Practicus Grade Papers it is stated, 'The Greek Cross of Thirteen Squares, the admission badge for the Path of Resh, is referred to the sun in the twelve signs of the zodiac, and also in the midst of the four elements.' Also in the Practicus 3=8 Ceremony, the Hierophant states, 'The solar Greek cross is formed of thirteen squares which fitly refer to the sun’s motion through the zodiac, these signs being further arranged in the arms of the cross according to the four elements with the sun in the centre and representing that luminary as the centre of the whole.'"

Whereas exoteric Astrology uses these ideas for fortune-telling, the esoteric version uses them to understand the universal patterns of life and energy, and how to use them for one's benefit.

The Zodiac is a belt segmented into twelve constellations that revolve around the Sun. These twelve may be broken up into groups of four (quadruplicities) by element or into groups of three (triplicities) by operation, i.e. cardinal, kerubic, or mutable.

1. Aries, I AM, ACTIVITY, Sight, Reason, Head and Face. Given that the Ram is known for being headstrong and aggressive, as well as virile, it is an appropriate mascot for this sign. This energy wants to win at any cost, but it runs out quickly.
2. Taurus, I HAVE, STABILITY, Hearing, Intuition, Neck and Throat. The bull, although strong and almost unstoppable, is very slow. It wants to be comfortable laying on grass underneath the shade. Yet when it sets to work, it does so with the endurance of a mountain climber.
3. Gemini, I THINK, VERSATILITY, Smell, Discrimination, Shoulders and Collar Bones and Lungs. The intellectual with an artistic temperment. Constantly on the go with ideas and places and people. A fast talker, therefore hyperactive in thought and action.
4. Cancer, I FEEL, DEVOTION, Speech, Receptivity to Divine Will, Breast and Stomach. Very nurturing, maternal, domestic, and supportive.
5. Leo, I WILL, MAGNETISM, Taste, The Law of Suggestion, Heart and Sides and Back. A natural leader, charismatic, ambitious, confident, yet charitable. Rex bonus.
6. Virgo, I ANALYZE, PRACTICALITY, Touch, The Law of Response, Intestines. Scientific, systematic, exacting, the computer scientist, the STEM lord, industrious, neat, and a perfectionist with a pen in his shirt pocket.
7. Libra, I BALANCE, HARMONY, Action, Equilibrium, Hips. Makes sure everyone gets along, the deal maker, the bridge builder, he who turns foes into friends, diplomatic, persuasive.
8. Scorpio, I DESIRE, INTENSITY, Motion, The Law of Dissolution and Transformtion, Genitals. Intense and passionate. A love for mystery and therefore investigation. When a scent is caught, very motivated and resourceful.
9. Sagittarius, I UNDERSTAND, VISUALIZATION, Wrath, Verification or The Law of Probation, Thighs & Liver. The open-hearted hippy, the smiling teenager who has yet to face the trials of life, yet has an interest in philosophy and religion.
10. Capricornus, I USE, AMBITION, Mirth or Laughter, Bondage, Knees and Bones and Sinews. Ambitious, hard working, the grinder, the corporate ladder game, THE EMPIRE BUILDER, responsible, conservative, serious.
11. Aquarius, I KNOW, IMAGINATION, Meditation, Revelation, Ankles. The intellect that excels especially in the arts and creating new forms yet also scientific and logical.
12. Pisces, I BELIEVE, UNDERSTANDING, Sleep, Organization, Feet. Very moody, introspective, sensitive, therefore also artistic, charitable, and sympathetic.
