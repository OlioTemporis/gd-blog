Aside from the Adeptus Minor one, the Neophyte ceremony is the crowning jewel of the GD system, for it represents the first step across the Threshold and unto the Ladder. It's purpose is to connect the candidate aura to the GD's egregore, to engrave within it certain symbols, and to begin the alchemical process of Nigredo.

Since there are a lot of moving parts to this particular one, it will prove difficult not only to memorize the script, but also the symbols and actions and roles. Therefore it is recommended to act prudently by attacking it piece by piece and role for role. For example, you should first tackle the first part of the ceremony (the Opening) and focus your efforts on memorizing all that which pertains to it, before moving on.

Do not worry, the other ceremonies are neither as long nor as ornamented as this one, because those focus on invoking and working with a particular element, whereas this one, as well as the one for Adeptus Minor, works with all Five.

Remember: you are not expected to pull this off in one go. During your time as a neophyte, practice portions of the ceremony to ease the burden overtime. On a specific date, go through from start to finish.

## Structure of the Neophyte Ceremony

Since you'll be doing this on your own, you must know this adept-level knowledge: the main part of the ceremony is not the one unfurling before your mundane eyes, bur rather in the astral realm, where each officer is maintaining a specific godform and function, while the Hierophant moves around the Astral Light throughout the Temple and into the canditate's aura of sensation.

In Crowley's _Magick in Theory and Practice_, chapter VI. The Formula of the Neophyte, he explains the general process:

1. the candidate is ignorant of everything (blind-folded) and incapable of anything (bounded)
2. his only aspiration is the Hierophant, his Higher Self
3. he is consecrated and purified, taken into the Temple, and makes an Oath, thereby formulating his Will
4. he engages in the mystic circumabulation to get the LVX going
5. consecrated and purified a second time, he confronts the Lord of the West to gain courage (for fear is the forerunner of failure)
6. consecrated and purified, he faces the Lord of the East who keeps him in balance
7. he is received as neophyte by the three main officers (thus uniting Cross with Triangle)
8. he is placed between the two pillars to recieve the final consecration and the secrets of the grade

Main point: to give something impotent and inert balanced motion in a given direction. Herein are many formulae, e.g. general invocation, consecration of weapons.
