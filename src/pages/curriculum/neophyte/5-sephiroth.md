The Tree of Life is a glyph that depicts how the Universe is structured, and by extension man himself. There are ten orbs known as Sephiroth ('numbers', 'spheres', 'emanations') and twenty-two paths connecting them. The former represents states of consciousness; the latter changes in consciousness.

## The Pillars

The Middle Pillar indicates the principle of balance in nature; the Left the principle of passivity; the Right the principle of activity.

- Left Pillar = anima, neschamah, subconsciousness, Yin, Salt, Water, Tamas (passivity), Mem, Ida, AVB
- Middle Pillar = the Tao, Mercury, Air, Sattva (Equilibrium), Aleph, Sushumna, AVR
- Right Pillar = animus, chiah, consciousness, Yang, Sulphur, Fire, Rajas (activity), Shin, Pingala, AVD

## The Sephiroth

Note: The images are very useful anthropomorphic characterisations of the
Sephiroth, and were used by the Golden Dawn for meditation, amongst other
things. Therefore it is recommended to construct a memory palace with ten spots to accomodate each one. Make sure while you are in the grade of neophyte that you constantly meditate upon these and note down in your magical record any insights.
