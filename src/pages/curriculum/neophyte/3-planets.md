Planets like the Sun have their energies constrained (detriment), deeply constrained (fall), aided (rules), or greatly aided (exaltation) depending on the sign. If a planet is opposite the sign they rule, they are in detriment; if opposite the sign in which they are exalted, they fall. Usually when a planet is in detriment, its good qualities are stifled; when it falls, its bad qualities are tuned up.

For example, Luna rules Cancer, which sits opposite of Capricorn, in which Luna is detrimented. Moreover, Luna is exalted in Taurus, which sits opposite of Scorpio, in which Luna falls. Therefore, when Luna is in Capricorn (detriment), its fluctuating nature is stifled and made stubborn; when in Scorpio (fall), its treacherous and changeable nature is greatly encouraged and given free rein.
