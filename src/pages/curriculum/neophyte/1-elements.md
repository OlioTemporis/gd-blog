There are four elements, all of which are unified by the fifth known as Spirit or Aethyr or Akasha. Everything that is and does is due to these.

Fire has the qualities of heat and dryness; water of cold and moisture; air of heat and moisture; earth of cold and dryness.

**Fire** is the active, masculine, quick, vitalizing energy. According to alchemists, it is the agent of transmutation because by it change in matter is achieved. Aside from its obvious destructive effects, it is also considered as a symbol for regeneration, for Aries leaps forth from the frost. The Sanskrit term for fire is Tejas, which is represented by an upright, red triangle. In the H.O.G.D., the grade of Philosophus 4=7 (Netzach) works on this element within himself.

- אש ASh, esh
- ignis
- πῦρ

<blockquote class="text-lg italic tracking-tigh">
    <p>The moral qualities appropriate to this figure are activity, generosity, fierceness, impetuosity, pride, impulsiveness, swiftness in unpredictable actions. If wrongly energized, he is evil-minded, cruel, bigoted and brutal. He is in either case ill-fitted to carry on his action; he has no means of modifying it according to circumstances. If he fails in his first effort, he has no resource.</p>
</blockquote>

Fire of fire is the LI (51st) Hexagram, Kan or zhèn, 'thunder'. This hexagram shows the trigram of 'fire' or 'thunder' stacked upon itself. It signifies the beginning of movement, especially the sudden and startling kind. It warns of potential danger but as long as you go in headfirst and with confidence, Fortuna has your back.

**Water** is the passive, feminine, reflective, and generative energy. In a Qabalistic sense, it is identified with the Great Mother of Forms, Binah, the Great Sea. It exists in the world of infinite possibilites. Therefore it is also associated with the astral realm and magic. The Sanskrit term for water is Apas, which is represented by a silver crescent on its side (like a bull's horns). In the H.O.G.D., the grade of Theoricus 3=8 (Hod) works on this element within himself.

- מים MIM, mayim
- aqua
- ὕδωρ

<blockquote class="text-lg italic tracking-tigh">
    <p>The characteristics associated with this card are principally dreaminess, illusion and tranquillity. She is the perfect agent and patient, able to receive and transmit everything without herself being affected thereby. If ill-dignified, all these qualities are degraded. Everything that passes through her is refracted and distorted. But, speaking generally, her characteristics depend mostly upon the influences which affect her.</p>
</blockquote>

**Air** is the active, masculine, communicative, intellectual, and abstract energy. It is the irritable and swift son of Fire and Water. As quickly as it brings two points or ideas together, it slices them apart. It is the therefore most active in the reasoning faculty of man. The Sanskrit term for air is Vayu, which is represented by a sky or baby blue circle. In the H.O.G.D., the grade of Theoricus 2=9 (Yesod) works on this element within himself.

- רוח RVCh, ruach
- aër
- ἀήρ

<blockquote class="text-lg italic tracking-tigh">
    <p>The operation of his logical mental processes have reduced the Air, which is his element, to many diverse geometrical patterns, but in these there is no real plan; they are demonstrations of the powers of the Mind without definite purpose. In his right hand is a lifted sword wherewith to create, but in his left hand a sickle, so that what he creates he instantly destroys. A person thus symbolized is purely intellectual. He is full of ideas and designs which tumble over each other. He is a mass of fine ideals unrelated to practical effort.</p>
</blockquote>

**Earth** is the passive, feminine, stable, grounded, and slow-moving energy. It is Spirit reified, along with the other three preceeding elements. Therefore it is a very special element: out of the Father, Mother, and Son came out the Daughter, Earth. This element mostly represents material matters, the body, and money. The Sanskrit term for Earth is Prithivi, which is represented by a yellow square. In the H.O.G.D., the grade of Zelator 1=10 (Malkuth) works on this element within himself.

- ארץ ARTz, erets
- terra
- γῆ

<blockquote class="text-lg italic tracking-tigh">
    <p>The characteristics of an individual signified by this card are too various to enumerate; one must summarize by saying that she is Womanhood in its ultimate projection. She contains all the characteristics of woman, and it would depend entirely upon the influences to which she is subjected whether one or another becomes manifest. It is rather like a lottery wheel from which the extraction of any number does not predict or influence the result of any subsequent operation. The fruit of the Philosophy of Thelema is enjoyed, rare, ripe, nourishing and vitalizing at its highest and fullest in this meditation; for to the adept every turn of the wheel is equally probable, and equally a prize; for every Event is 'a play of Nuit'.</p>
