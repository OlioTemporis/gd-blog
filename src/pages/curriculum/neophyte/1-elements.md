There are four elements, all of which are unified by the fifth known as Spirit or Aethyr or Akasha. Everything that is and does is due to these.

Fire has the qualities of heat and dryness; water of cold and moisture; air of heat and moisture; earth of cold and dryness.

**Fire** is the active, masculine, quick, vitalizing energy. According to alchemists, it is the agent of transmutation because by it change in matter is achieved. Aside from its obvious destructive effects, it is also considered as a symbol for regeneration, for Aries leaps forth from the frost. The Sanskrit term for fire is Tejas, which is represented by an upright, red triangle.

- אש ASh, esh
- ignis
- πῦρ

**Water** is the passive, feminine, reflective, and generative energy. In a Qabalistic sense, it is identified with the Great Mother of Forms, Binah, the Great Sea. It exists in the world of infinite possibilites. Therefore it is also associated with the astral realm and magic. The Sanskrit term for water is Apas, which is represented by a silver crescent on its side (like a bull's horns).

- מים MIM, mayim
- aqua
- ὕδωρ

**Air** is the active, masculine, communicative, intellectual, and abstract energy. It is the irritable and swift son of Fire and Water. As quickly as it brings two points or ideas together, it slices them apart. It is the therefore most active in the reasoning faculty of man. The Sanskrit term for air is Vayu, which is represented by a sky or baby blue circle.

- רוח RVCh, ruach
- aër
- ἀήρ

**Earth** is the passive, feminine, stable, grounded, and slow-moving energy. It is Spirit reified, along with the other three preceeding elements. Therefore it is a very special element: out of the Father, Mother, and Son came out the Daughter, Earth. This element mostly represents material matters, the body, and money. The Sanskrit term for Earth is Prithivi, which is represented by a yellow square.

- ארץ ARTz, erets
- terra
- γῆ
