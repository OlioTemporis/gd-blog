The Qabalah means 'tradition' and it relates to the Jewish mystical framework. Its knowledge is communicated mainly by symbols and metaphors, since knowledge at this level requires this type of garb in Yetzirah. Its goal is to lead to an understanding of one's self, and by consequence Creation itself.

It is for this reason Dion Fortune calls it the 'Yoga of the West' for it is by this system that a westerner is best equipped to ascend the Mountain. In her case, she viewed it as a set of tools for change in consciousness. This system teaches universal laws and principles that greatly aid one's life when put into practice; it is not simply for mystical attainment.

Moreover, by the study of the Qabalah, the student's Higher Self has a better chance of communicating with him, since the lower self has been made aware of certain concepts and symbols. It also cleanses and prepares the student's body as a vessel for divine energy and entities. Once accomplished, the student will find himself supplied by hidden rivers that he can turn on and off as he wills. In other words, the study of Qabalah begins an alchemical process within the mind.

To give a practical example, say you are scrying in the spirit vision. You are trying to reach the astral realm of Trump 12 The Hanged Man, the Water element. Therefore, knowing the qabalistic correspondences to Path 23, you will know when you are in the right spot once you see eagles and snakes and scorpions and dolphins and a lot of water. For plants, you'd see lotuses. For gods, you'd see Poseidon or Neptune.

Another tool of Qabalah is Gematria which uses the numerical values of words or phrases to find hidden links. The Talmud (ThLMVD) for example adds up to 480. The name of the archdemoness Lilith (LILITh) also adds up to 480, meaning that the study of the traditional rabbincal interpretation of the Torah is an act against God, just as Lilith represents divine antinomism.

Finally, it has a tradition of certain spiritual exercises to reach ecstatic states, certain astral realms, by means of chanting certain holy names.
