The Golden Dawn was first opened in 1888 and continued the Rosicrucian system of initiation with a focus on practical magic. Most of this orders, since antiquity, have sought to create a link between the initiate and his HGA (Augoeides, Supernal). Therefore, in the GD tradition, the crowning point of their system is achieved in the grade of 5=6, Adeptus Minor, when the divine LVX descends down into the conscious mind of the candidate.

The process of this particular initiation, on top of having a Sephirotic basis, may be explained in elements and alchemy. At each stage, one must _solve_ the bad properities of a given element and _coagula_ the good ones:

1. Earth - the candidate focuses on getting his mundane life in order, because now he is about to attempt to dedicate himself unto the Great Work, therefore all obstacles to it should be minimized. Moreover, things such as laziness, sensuality, addiction etc are taken care, i.e. the bad properties of earth.
2. Air - the candidate focuses on his intellectual side, e.g. daily intellectual practices like memory palace walk-throughs.
3. Water - the emotional side
4. Fire - the Will, carrying through

For the most part, the original order reserved techniques on practical magic for the Second Order, i.e. post-Adeptus Minor. The crowning jewel of the system was the Enochian magic, yet it must be noted that it was greatly altered from its original Dee version.

The main form of magic practiced in the Outer Order is that of theurgy, or invocation to use its Latin equivalent. For as it is written in Matthew 9:17, "Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved." In other words, the new wine is LVX or the Light from the Supernal Triangle, the HGA, with whom we establish a connection in Tiphareth; the old bottles are our minds and bodies before undergoing the neophyte initiation.

By using daily invocational techniques like the Pentagram Ritual and the Middle Pillar Ritual, we are repairing our "old bottle" into a new one. Also by focusing on a particular "element" to work on during each step of the initiation simplifies the process because it gives us a traditional map on how to proceed in this spiritual alchemical process.

The interim between Philosophus and Adeptus Minor is known as the Portal grade, in which the four previous elements you've been working on are further refined and under the rulership of Spirit, so that you may be worthy of receiving the LVX. Israel Regardie recommends at least nine months in Portal before undergoing the Adeptus Minor ceremony, for it is probably the most nerve shattering moment to have in one's life.

To close, Regardie also recommended that the candidate focus on doing "discursive meditations" on the symbols, and words, and lamens, and concepts related to their grade, in order to further engrave them into his sphere of sensation. Wherefore, constant visualizations and playthroughs of the respective ceremony must also be done.

This is why he claims that having a physical group of people to initiate you is no longer the only way, now that he has published the system in full. Although the method of physical initiation is much more effective, the self-initiation route is possible through constant practice of the grade specific symbols, daily LBRP + MP, and constant visualization of the grade specific ceremony. Also add in the corresponding elemental prayer to your daily routine to further immerse yourself.
