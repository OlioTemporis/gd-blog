Since Air is the intermediary between Fire and Water, it may be used to recalibrate one's elemental composition, since by reason we may determine the composition thereof and ascertain the required modifications.

The Theoricus is expected to memorize the corresponding incense to every Sephira, planet, and Zodiac sign, since incense is considered a part of the Air element. It is used in temples and operations to attune the space to the desired vibration.

Now for those pertaining to Air, memorize these as well:

- Hebrew name: Ruach
- Outer Divine name: Shaddai El Chai
- Elemental godname: IHVH
- Archangel: Raphael Ruachel
- Angel: Chassan
- Ruler: Aral
- Elementals: Sylphs
- King of Slyphs: Paralda
- Gods: Egyptian, Shu; Sumero-Babylonian, Enlil and Ellil; Greek, Zeus and Aeolos; Roman, Pan and Silvanus Aeolus
