The Solid Greek Cubical Cross (seen above) is the Admission Badge for the 32nd Path of Tau in the grade of Theoricus. It is made out of twenty-two squares, one for each Hebrew letter. The cross is an emblem for equilibrium and balance in the four elements. Moreover, in this balance is also held the planets and zodiac signs.

The Caduceus of Hermes is the Admission Badge which grants the candidate entry into the temple of Yesod. This symbol is first found amongst the Sumerians, since two intertwined serpents represented for them their god of healing. In GD symbolism, it pertains to the office of Keryx.

The following are also discussed:

- The Flaming Sword with the Kerubim (previously explained in Zelator)
- The Serpent of Wisdom (the path connecting all ten Sephiroth)
- The 21st Tarot Key, the Universe
