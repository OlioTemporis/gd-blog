The Right and Left Pillars, their relation to the right and left sides of man, and the phases of the Moon.

When the Moon is waxing, it is representing the Right Pillar of Mercy; when waning, the Left Pillar of Severity.

Also note that in ceremonies, the Left Pillar is placed on the northern half of the temple and the Right Pillar in the southern half.
