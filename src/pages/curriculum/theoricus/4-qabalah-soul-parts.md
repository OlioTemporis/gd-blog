Qabalists divide the soul into three principle parts: the Neshamah, the Ruach, and the Nephesh. The Neshamah is what Freud would call the superego and belongs to the supernals.

The Yechidah is centered in Kether. It is our true and immortal Divine Self. The Chiah, located in Chokmah is our inquisitive urge to become more than human-it is our True Will. Both the Yechidah and the Chiah are archetypal in essence and thus they are somewhat beyond the scope of our understanding. The final subdivision, the Neshamah is placed in Binah, although it lends its name to the other Supernals as being generally descriptive of the Soul's greatest aspirations. This is our true desire or highest state of consciousness-the intuitive power that connects humankind with the Divine.

The Neshamah remains dormant unless awakened through initiation. It supposedly happens fully upon reaching Tiphareth, the hieros gamos.

The Ruach is the conscious part of our mind, the Ego. It acts as an intermediary between the Neshamah and the Nephesh.

The Nephesh is the lowest part of the soul and considered its dark or shadow side, since it functions like a wild animal devoid of reason. Upon being born, our Nephesh is the first part of the soul that is activated.

Another level may be added below Nephesh: G'uph. This is a soul level below Nephesh and is closely tied to the physical body. It controls our psychophysical functions that communicates with the brain about the current status of the body.
