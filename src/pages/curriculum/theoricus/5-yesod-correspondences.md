The 2 = 9 grade is attributed to the sphere of Yesod on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Yesod is the ninth Sephirah on the Tree and the second sphere encountered by the aspiring initiate. It is the realm of the Akasha or astral Light, as the substance which underlies all dense matter. (Review all information on Yesod given in Chapter One.)
