In the Zelator grade, you learned about the first Qabalistic world, Assiah. In Theoricus you learn about the second, Yetzirah, in which the angels, intelligences, spirits, and images formed by the minds of men exist.

- **Astral Spirits** - these include the Qliphoth and the ghosts of those who have recently died but have yet to move on.
- **Elementals** - these include gnomes, slyphs, undines, and salamanders. They are seen as childlike and innocent compared to the human realm.
- **Angels and Archangels** - these are entities who are wholly good and carry out specific functions for God. The Archangels command their specific groups of angels.
- **The Soul** - The soul acts as a bridge between the spirit within and the outside world. The more one lives according to one's lower-self, the less in touch is his soul with his spirit. The goal of initiation is to clear the blocks between your soul and spirit.
- **The Spirit** - the divine center in man, the animating agent, and the pattern of divinity. The Greeks called it νοῦς, δαίμων, and πνεῦμα.
- **Planetary Intelligences and Spirits** - in planetary magic, an _intelligence_ is a guiding angelic force for planetary spirits. To make sure the spirit operates as expected, always make sure you are working with it through its superior intelligence. These intelligences answer to their planet's archangel.
