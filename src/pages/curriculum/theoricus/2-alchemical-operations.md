The goal of Alchemy is to obtain the Quintessence. This is done in the following stages:

1. The material to undergo the process of transmutation exists with a state of Chaos (Void) which must be separated and categorized to fit into the fourfold model of the Elements
2. The alchemist then uses reason to apply this same fourfold model to the First Matter, intellectually structuring it into the divisions of the four Elements.
3. The Spirit or First Essence (Spiritus Mundi) is then drawn out of the First Matter (implanted within the Alchemist's psyche).
4. This Hidden Essence is then divided or broken down (through the Unbodied Volatile) into the Triad of the Alchemical Principles (Mercury, Salt and Sulfur).

At length the Quintessence, which is the synthesis of these Three Principles as well as the sustaining Life Force, is obtained.

These four stages are represented by colors and elements, the very colors the materia becomes as it undergoes that particular stage:

1. **MELANOSIS** - Blackening (Earth) also called Nigredo (Assiah). Obtained from of a process of separation, death, dissolution or putrefaction.
2. **LEUKOSIS** - Whitening (Water) also called Albedo (Yetzirah). a washing or cleansing process, a resurrection and the release of the pure essence. (This results in the white tincture or Lunar essence symbolized by the White Queen.)
3. **XANTHOSIS** - Yellowing (Air) also called Citrinitas (Briah). The dawning of solar light, transitioning from the silver "white" of albedo to the gold "red" of rubedo. Spiritually, it symbolizes awakening, consciousness, and the emergence of inner wisdom, often associated with the "wise old man" archetype in Jungian psychology
4. **IOSIS** - Reddening (Fire) also called Rubedo (Atziluth). Results from the raising of heat to its highest intensity. (The Red King or Solar essence is the symbol here.)

Some modern occultists have paired these to the Sephiroth upon the Tree of Life. To reflect the GD's version of the four worlds: Nigredo takes place in Assiah (Neophyte/Zelator); Albedo in Yetzirah (Theoricus to Adeptus Exemptus); Citrinitas in Briah (Magister Templi and Magus); Rubedo in Atziluth (Ipsissimus). Therefore the consciousness of the Adeptus Minor is currently undergoing the process of Albedo. Again, this mapping may be adjusted depending on where the borders between the four worlds are drawn.

NOTE: after the 1500s, Citrinitas was dropped. Also, sometimes blue was used as an intermediate stage between Melanosis and Xanthosis, and sometimes vioelet was used after Iosis to indicate the limit of the process.

The planets have the following colors associated to them in Alchemy:

1. Saturn - Black - Lead
2. Jupiter - Blue - Tin
3. Mercury - Multicolored (Peacock's Tail) - Quicksilver
4. Luna - White - Silver
5. Venus - Yellow - Copper
6. Mars - Red - Iron
7. Sol - Violet - Gold

As you could've figured out, Saturn represents the first stage of Nigredo or Melanosis, Luna = Leukosis/Albedo, Venus = Xanthosis/Citrinitas, Mars = Iosis/Rubedo. Finally Sol represents that one extra step beyond Rubedo.

This is how GD (Cicero) pairs the 7-part alchemical operation to the planets:

1. Calcination - Mercury
2. Sublimation - Saturn
3. Solution - Jupiter
4. Putrefaction - Luna
5. Distillation - Mars
6. Coagulation - Venus
7. Tincture - Sol

Unfortunately, Pat Zalewiski offers this variation (see his alchemical attributions to the planetary trumps in _The Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn_). Looks like the papers published by Regardie make no mention of these attributions:

1. Calcination - Mars
2. Sublimation - Jupiter
3. Solution - Venus
4. Putrefaction - Luna
5. Distillation - Mercury
6. Coagulation - Saturn
7. Tincture/Lapidication - Sol

## Alchemical Operations

- CALCINATION: Reducing the principles to atoms, but not by burning.
- CIBATION: (or IMBIBATION) When the matter in the vessels appears dry, it is wetted again. It provides a mild heat.
- CIRCULATION: (This process may also include the processes of cohobation, digestion, distillation and sublimation.) It is the betterment, progress or Exaltation of a liquid through repeated dissolution and coagulation (usually in the Pelican vessel) using heat. The liquid is brought by repeated changes from liquid to vapor to liquid again.
- COHOBATION: Anumber of repeated distillations of a solvent over a substance or substances which have been dissolved into it. The process loosens the structure of certain substances, volatilizing the solids which are thus loosened by the solvent.
- CONGEALATION: Reducing the substance to liquid which then thickens. The liquefied matter congeals or solidifies.
- CONJUNCTION: Joining the principles. Amalgamating the various elements.
- DESPONSATION: The separation of liquids in a vessel.
- DIGESTION: Amixture for the purpose of drawing out the Essence from the different substances.
- DISSOLUTION: Dissolving the metals. Indicates letting time and nature do the work. Aslow separation of a metal into its components in a liquid.
- DISTILLATION: Also called Circulation or Rectification because it entails a continuous cycle (rising and falling). The process of boiling a liquid until it is vaporized, and then recondensed by cooling. The rising vapor is considered the Spirit of the substance. This process liberates the original metal from its corrupted state, while giving it new properties. The energy inherent in the rising vapors generates the multi-eolors of the Peacock's tail. The substance is then heated more vigorously until it dries up into a grayish-black mass. When the color white is seen, it signifies that the process of coagulation is about to commence. (In mystical Alchemy, distillation entails the liberation of the Soul from the grip of the Lower Ego. This transformation implies that the ego has become purified and compliant to the Higher Self.)
- EXALTATION:To elevate the Power of Virtue in the hope that the substance will transmute.
- FERMENTATION: Adding the required precious metal as a yeast to the Philosopher's Stone enabling it to transmute base metals into this particular precious metal. It is associated with putrefaction and decay, but also the work of Transformation and regeneration-Death which leads to Life. (In mystical Alchemy,fermentation implies the liberation ofintuitive powers and the creation of dreams.)
- LIGATION: Separation in a sealed vessel.
- MULTIPLICATION: Raising the quantity and quality of the powder or stone.
- PROJECTION: The work of transmutation into gold and silver.
- PUTREFACTION: The first change to be seen. The appearance of blackness.
- ROTATION: Rhythmic cycling of the process of circulation. It entails the boiling of a liquid for a set period of time in a reflux system. The liquid is allowed to cool, reheated, and allowed to cool again, etc.
- SEPARATION: Separating the light parts from the heavy parts. The slow separation of a body into its components in a liquid. SOLUTION: Dissolving a solid into a liquid.
- SUBLIMATION: Extraction by volatilization or distillation. This process entails forcing an extract upwards into the upper portion of a container where it is allowed to precipitate. Also called Rectification.
