## Elementals in Western Esoteric Tradition

Elementals are nonphysical entities composed entirely of one of the four classical magical Elements: Earth, Air, Water, or Fire. They represent the spiritual counterparts of natural forces. Unlike humans or higher spiritual beings, which possess composite natures, Elementals consist of a single elemental essence. In the spiritual hierarchy, they occupy an intermediate position between humanity and higher celestial beings such as Angels and Archangels.

### The Four Orders of Elementals

#### Gnomes — Spirits of Earth

Gnomes derive their name from a Greek term meaning “earth dweller.” Their vibration closely aligns with the physical Earth, granting them influence over minerals, stones, metals, vegetation, and the mineral components within living bodies. Traditionally regarded as guardians of hidden treasures, they appear in folklore as elves, satyrs, brownies, and dryads. They are associated with patience and diligence, though sometimes depicted as stubborn or malicious. Gnomes correspond to the North and are ruled by King Ghob.

#### Sylphs — Spirits of Air

Sylphs inhabit a subtle spiritual atmosphere rather than the physical air. Their element possesses the highest vibrational rate among the four, placing them at the highest rank among Elementals. They operate through winds, clouds, gases, and the etheric field connected to the human nervous system. Sylphs are portrayed as winged fairies and are linked to inspiration, creativity, and artistic influence. They are assigned to the East and are ruled by King Paralda.

#### Undines — Spirits of Water

Undines function within the spiritual substance associated with liquid and moisture. Their influence extends to natural water systems and the vital fluids of living organisms. Mythological depictions include water nymphs, mermaids, and water sprites. Undines are typically described as graceful and life-supporting forces. They correspond to the West and are ruled by Queen Nichsa.

#### Salamanders — Spirits of Fire

Salamanders inhabit the spiritual essence underlying physical fire and heat. They influence biological warmth, emotional intensity, and energetic vitality through the bloodstream and body heat. Often portrayed as flames, fiery spheres, or reptilian fire-beings, they are regarded as powerful, volatile, and difficult to approach. Incense smoke is traditionally considered a medium for their manifestation. Salamanders correspond to the South and are ruled by the fiery King Djin.

### Symbolic and Liturgical Role

In esoteric traditions, these four elemental orders are regarded as fundamental spiritual forces within nature and are sometimes invoked symbolically in liturgical or mystical contexts, including references to the praise of divine creation.
