## Tetragrammaton - IHVH

This is the four-fold formula for how the Universe is constructed. Each letter refers to an element, a qabalistic world, and a part of the soul. In other words, there are four parts to the Singularity.

1. Yod, Fire, Atziluth (the Archetypal World), Chiah (the Life Force)
2. Heh, Water, Briah (the Creative World), Neshamah (the Soul-Intuition, intuitive based thinking)
3. Vav, Air, Yetzirah (the Formative World), Ruach (the Intellect, reason based thinking)
4. Final Heh, Earth, Assiah (the World of Action), Nephesh (the Animal Soul)

The following exercise will allow you to acquaint yourself with the four Qabalistic Worlds. It may be used for any object:

1. Find a chair to sit in, close your eyes, and begin to meditate.
2. Assiah - feel the chair you are sitting upon through your senses, begin to think of its separate material components (the back, set, and legs)
3. Yetzirah - instead of using your physical senses, using your imagination reconstruct the chair and inspect it once again with your senses. Realize that the chair you are sitting upon exists as an idea in Yetzirah.
4. Briah - begin to think about why there is a need for chairs then about all the different types of chairs. Realize that the general **need** for chairs and the **variations** thereof exist in Briah.
5. Atziluth - now that you have figured out that the general need for chairs is **rest**, begin to meditate on rest in general (rest from work; from strife; from consciousness; from motion). All of these branches emanating from **rest** exist in Atziluth.

## The Kerubim

These are the living powers of IHVH in Assiah and are the Presidents of their respective element. They operate through the Fixed or Kerubic signs of the Zodiac:

1. ARYEH - Fire, the Lion, Leo, Yod
2. NESHER - Water, the Eagle, Scorpio, Heh
3. ADAM - Air, the Man, Aquarius, Vav
4. SHOR - Earth, the Bull, Taurus, Heh Final

During GD ceremonies, they are part of the Invisible Stations, so they are to be visualized hovering over their respective cardinal direction, e.g. Aryeh would be in the South of the temple hovering over the Fire Tablet and the Dadouchos.

The Kerubim are also the guardians over the four rivers in Eden which they protect from the sight of fallen humanity. They are also depicted in Ezekiel's vision.

The Egyptian version of the Kerubim (pictured above):

1. Ahathoor (Human-headed) AIR-stationed in the East.
2. Tharpesh (Lion-headed) FIRE-stationed in the South.
3. Thoum Moou (Eagle-headed) WATER-stationed in the West.
4. Hap-Ouer (Bull-headed) EARTH-stationed in the North.
