The twenty-two Hebrew letters are divided into three categories:

1. Mother Letters - attributed to the three elements
2. Double Letters - attributed to the seven planets, and a dual set of properties
3. Single Letters - attributed to the twelve signs of the Zodiac, the twelve months, twelve organs, and twelve human properties

- Heh-Sight
- Vav-Hearing
- Zayin-Smell
- Cheth-Speech
- Teth-Taste
- Yod-Sexual Love
- Lamed-Work
- Nun-Movement
- Samekh-Anger
- Ayin-Mirth
- Tzaddi-Imagination
- Qoph-Sleep

In GD symbology, The Holy Place or Tabernacle as described in the Zelator Hall embraces the symbolism of the Twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet: The Table of Shewbread represents the Twelve Single Letters. The Seven-Branched Candlestick alludes to the Seven Double Letters. The Altar of Incense refers to the Three Mother Letters.

## The Four Worlds

As the LVX from Kether came down, on top of the nine other Sephiroth, four worlds were created. They functions like layers in an onion. Therefore, in Assiah, we are the furthest removed from Atziluth.

1. אצילות ATzILVTh (Olahm ha-Atziluth, the Archetypal World, the World of Emanations, lit. 'close to the light'). Here reside the templates of creation, the Telos version of everything is in Assiah. The word = 537, which is also the sum to all the letters of the vertical paths across the three pillars, indicating that the origin of these Three began in Atziluth. Although some systems include Chokmah and Binah in this world, the Ciceros consider Kether alone as part of it.
2. בריאה BRIAH (Olahm ha-Briah, the Creative World, the World of Creation). The templates in Atziluth become more fleshed out with detail here. Whatever is willed in Atziluth begins to take form here as ideas. Therefore it is considered as the World of Pure Intellect. Ezekiel describes it as a Throne made of sapphire. Although some systems use Chesed, Geburah, and Tiphareth for this world, the Ciceros consider Chokmah and Binah as part of it.
3. יצירה ITzIRH (Olahm ha-Yetzirah, the World of Formation). Here angels start to carry out the patterns created by the Archangels in Briah. At this level the Initiate climbs through the Seven Rungs of Jacob's Ladder, i.e. Chesed - Yesod. Therefore, although some systems use Netzach, Hod and Yesod for this world, GD considers Chesed to Yesod to belong in Yetzirah, thereby sticking to the Seven Palaces system.
4. עשיה AShIH (Olahm ha-Assiah, the World of Action). Here is the world of material, the one we all experience through our senses. Here also exists the gate unto the Sitra Achra, since both Malkuth and the Qlipha Lilith overlap one another in Assiah.

## The Ten Heavens or Houses of Assiah

These relate to the physical manifestations (i.e. their representatives in Assiah) of the ten Sephiroth through the seven classical planets and astronomical forces.

1. Rashith ha-Gilgalim (RAShITh HGLGLIM), the Primum Mobile, 'the First Whirlings', Kether.
2. Mazloth (MZLVTh), 'the stations', the Zodiac, Chokmah.
3. Shabbathai (ShBThAI), 'the seventh one', Saturn, Binah.
4. Tzedek (TzDQ), 'the righteous', Juppiter, Chesed.
5. Madim (MDIM), 'forces', Mars, Geburah.
6. Shemesh (ShMSh), from the Sumerian's sun-god name Shamash, Sol, Tiphareth.
7. Nogah (NVGH), 'the shiner', Venus, Netzach.
8. Kokab (KVKB), 'star', Mercury, Hod.
9. Levannah (LBNH), Luna, Yesod.
10. Olam Yesodoth (OVLM ISVDVTh), 'world of foundations', the sphere of the elements, Malkuth.

## The Divine Names of the Sephiroth, Archangels, Angels, Intelligences, Spirits

The Sephiroth have different names according to the Qabalistic World: as an example, Yesod in Assiah is Levannah; in Yetzirah, Kerubim; in Briah, Gabriel; in Atziluth, Shaddai El Chai.

In Atziluth, the Sephirah exists as pure energy; in Briah, in the form of an Archangel/Deity which gives that energy a direction; in Yetzirah, in the form of a choir of angels which take that energy as determined by the archangel; in Assiah, in the form of spirits/intelligences that make it manifest.

Therefore, for each Sephirah, you must memorize its divine name, archangel, and angelic choir. The same must be done for the planets. Do note that a Sephirah's Archangel will not always match the planet's.

- Venus: gd = IHVH Tzabaoth, aa = Anael (ANAL), intelligence = Hagiel (HGIAL)
- Netzach: gd = IHVH Tzabaoth, aa = Haniel (HANIAL), choir = Elohim (ALHIM)

Note, in many instances, Anael is confused with Haniel, as in Greer's _Circles of Power_. These two are distinct. Also in the same book he has the angelic choir for both being the Tarshishim (ThRShIShIM).

1. Kether, Eheieh (AHIH), Metatron (MTTRVN), Chayoth ha-Qodesh (ChIVTh HQDSh, 'holy living creatures')
2. Chokmah, Yah (IH), Raziel (RZIAL), Ophanim 'the wheels'
3. Binah, IHVH Elohim (IHVH ALHIM), Tzaphqiel (TzPQIAL), Erelim 'the thrones'

- Saturn (Shabbatai), IHVH ALHIM, Kassiel (KSIAL), intelligence: Agiel (AGIAL), spirit: Zazel (ZAZL)

4. Chesed, El (AL), Tzadqiel (TzDQIAL), Chashmalim 'the shining/brilliant ones'

- Juppiter (Tzedek), AL, Sachiel (SChIAL), intelligence: Iophiel (IHPIAL), spirit: Hismael (HSMAL)

5. Geburah, Elohim Gibor (ALHIM GBVR), Khamael (KMAL), Seraphim 'the flaming ones'

- Mars (Madim), ALHIM GIBVR, Zamael (ZMAL), intelligence: Graphiel (GRAPIAL), spirit: Bartzabel (BRTzBAL)

6. Tiphareth, IHVH Eloah va-Daath (IHVH ALVH VDOTh), Raphael (RPAL), Melekim 'the kings/messengers/virtues'

- Sol (Shemesh), IHVH ALVH VDOTh, Mikael Shemeshel, intelligence: Nakhiel (NKIAL), spirit: Sorath (SVRTh)

7. Netzach, IHVH Tzabaoth (IHVH TzBAVTh), Haniel (HANIAL), Elohim 'the gods/principles'

- Venus (Nogah), IHVH TzBAVTh, Anael (ANAL), intelligence: Hagiel (HGIAL), spirit: Qedemel (QDMAL)

8. Hod, Elohim Tzabaoth (ALHIM TzBAVTh), Mikael (MIKAL), Beni Elohim 'sons of the gods'

- Mercury (Kokab), ALHIM TzBAVTh, Raphael Kokabiel, intelligence: Tiriel (TIRIAL), spirit: Taphthartharath

9. Yesod, Shaddai El Chai (ShDI AL ChI), Gabriel (GBRIAL), Kerubim 'the strong ones'

- Luna (Levannah), ShDI AL ChI, Gabriel Levannael, Intelligence: Shelachel (ShLChAL), the spirit of spirits of Luna: Shad Barschemoth ha-Shartathan, spirit: Chasmodai

10. Malkuth, Adonai ha-Aretz (ADNI HARTz), Sandalphon (SNDLPVN), Ashim 'souls of fire'

- Earth element, ADNI, Auriel, angel: Phorlakh

Tradition has it that spirits are evil and intelligences are good. In actuality, spirits are dumb and blind and will cause trouble if not paired with their superiors, the intelligences.

Note: most of the names of the spirits and intelligences add up to the sum of the magical square or qamea of their respective planet. Keep this in mind in order to test entities you'll meet in your astral travels, e.g. the solar spirit (or demon) Sorath adds up to 666 (60 + 6 + 200 + 400, SVRTh), the sum of the Solar magical square.

The way GD uses all these names is by starting from Atziluth and working your way down the chain of command. For example, if you wanted to work with Sorath, the solar spirit, you begin with the godname of Sol/Tiphareth (the godname of the Sephirah will always match its corresponding planet's) which is IHVH Eloah va-Daath; then Sol's archangel, Mikael Shemeshel; then Sol's intelligence, Nakhiel; finally you can command Sorath.

Nick Farrell advises to use a spirit to charge a talisman, since they live the closest to us, thereby making it more powerful, but to make sure that you get its intelligence to order it to do so to avoid funny business.

## The Zodiac's Archangels

The Zodiac signs derive their godnames from their respective element, but each one has its own unique archangel and intelligence/angel.

1. Aries, ALHIM, Malkhidael, Sharahiel
2. Taurus, ADNI, Asmodel, Eraziel
3. Gemini, IHVH, Ambriel, Serayel
4. Cancer, AL, Muriel, Pakhiel
5. Leo, ALHIM, Verkhiel, Sheratiel
6. Virgo, ADNI, Hamaliel, Shelathiel
7. Libra, IHVH, Zuriel, Chadaqiel
8. Scorpio, AL, Barkhiel, Sayitziel
9. Sagittarius, ALHIM, Adnakhiel (in the past, mispelled as Advakhiel), Saritaiel
10. Capricornus, ADNI, Hanael, Semaqiel
11. Aquarius, IHVH, Kambriel, Tzakmaqiel
12. Pisces, AL, Amnitziel, Vakhabiel

These signs also have 'guardian' angels for those born under their sign, either by Sol or Luna. Therefore, in the list below, if your Sol was in Cancer, your solar angel would be Gabriel, and if your Luna in Scorpio, your lunar angel would be Samael. Below, Nick Farrell in _Making Talismans_ provides a list on page 90 of these angels:

1. Aries, Samael
2. Taurus, Haniel
3. Gemini, Raphael
4. Cancer, Gabriel
5. Leo, Michael
6. Virgo, Raphael
7. Libra, Haniel
8. Scorpio, Samael
9. Sagittarius, Sachiel
10. Capricorn, Cassiel
11. Aquarius, Uriel
12. Pisces, Sachiel

You should contact your respective ones within the astral temple for Earth. Once done, they will act as your spiritual guides and links to other angels and intelligences with whom you may wish to work for X operation.

For example, you want to make a Saturnian talisman therefore you need to get a hold of its intelligence Agiel to get a spirit like Zazel to power it. Instead of going to Saturn's temple in Yetzirah and cold-calling Agiel, you may meet your solar/lunar angel in the Earth temple, pass on your request to meet Agiel, then they will either tell him or take you themselves to the Temple of Saturn and call Agiel on your behalf.
