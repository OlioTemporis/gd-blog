Astrological houses are twelve equal 30-degree divisions of the zodiacal wheel that represent areas of human activity. Unlike zodiac signs, which are fixed celestial divisions, houses are determined by the time and place of birth and shift as Earth rotates, causing planets and signs to move through each house daily. The first house begins at the Ascendant, the sign rising on the eastern horizon at birth. The seventh house begins at the Descendant on the western horizon, while the Midheaven marks the tenth house cusp at the chart’s highest point, and the Imum Coeli marks the fourth house cusp at the lowest point.

Each house symbolizes a specific field of experience and is influenced by both planetary rulership and associated zodiac signs. Activity within a house occurs even if no planet is present. Cusps mark boundaries between houses and signs; planets near these boundaries may express combined influences and are considered strengthened. Each house also contains three ten-degree subdivisions called decans.

Houses can be grouped by elemental associations derived from the signs linked to them. Fire houses (first, fifth, ninth) emphasize energy, motivation, and inspiration. Water houses (fourth, eighth, twelfth) emphasize emotion and intuition. Air houses (third, seventh, eleventh) emphasize communication and social interaction. Earth houses (second, sixth, tenth) emphasize practicality and stability.

Houses are also classified by quality. Angular houses (first, fourth, seventh, tenth) correspond to cardinal qualities and amplify planetary influence and action. Succedent houses (second, fifth, eighth, eleventh) follow angular houses and emphasize stability and material concerns. Cadent houses (third, sixth, ninth, twelfth) correspond to mutable qualities and emphasize adaptability and mental or intellectual activity.

## The Houses

The first house represents identity, personality, physical appearance, and general outlook on life. It is associated with Aries, ruled by Mars, and emphasizes beginnings and self-expression.

The second house governs resources, possessions, financial matters, personal values, talents, and self-worth. It is associated with Taurus and ruled by Venus.

The third house concerns communication, learning, mental skills, short travel, transportation, and relationships with siblings. It represents the conscious and analytical mind and is associated with Gemini and Mercury.

The fourth house relates to home, family, ancestry, foundational character, property, and later life circumstances. It is associated with Cancer and ruled by the Moon.

The fifth house governs romance, pleasure, creativity, artistic expression, social activity, speculation, and children. It is associated with Leo and ruled by the Sun.

The sixth house addresses work, service, employment, health, hygiene, daily routines, personal habits, dependents, and pets. It is associated with Virgo and ruled by Mercury.

The seventh house concerns marriage, partnerships, contracts, public relations, cooperation, open conflicts, and close interpersonal relationships. It is associated with Libra and ruled by Venus.

The eighth house addresses transformation, regeneration, sexuality, hidden influences, occult subjects, inheritance, shared finances, and matters relating to death and rebirth. It is associated with Scorpio and ruled by Pluto and Mars.

The ninth house represents philosophy, spirituality, higher learning, religion, ethics, long-distance travel, and international or cultural exchanges. It is associated with Sagittarius and ruled by Jupiter.

The tenth house governs public status, career, ambition, achievements, authority, reputation, and social standing. It is associated with Capricorn and ruled by Saturn.

The eleventh house concerns friendships, social networks, aspirations, goals, humanitarian interests, and group affiliations. It is associated with Aquarius and ruled by Uranus and Saturn.

The twelfth house relates to the subconscious, hidden strengths and weaknesses, secrets, confinement, self-undoing, and unresolved psychological or karmic influences. It is associated with Pisces and ruled by Neptune and Jupiter.

Astrological meridians divide the chart into interpretive axes. The horizontal axis, or horizon, separates the chart into day and night halves, representing objective, outward tendencies versus instinctive, inward tendencies. The vertical axis, or meridian, divides the chart into eastern and western halves, distinguishing between rising planets associated with individual will and initiative, and setting planets associated with responsiveness and involvement in the lives of others.
