Since this is the grade of Zelator, the element worked with is earth. In our psyche, it is the grounded ego we carry day to day; in nature, it is corporeality and physical manifestation.

As such, you should be studying gemstones and minerals. The human body's first symbol was the rock. Then it became abstracted into a cube or pedestal. Stones and rocks became symbols of endurance, strength, and longeveity.

Stones and minerals have certain vibrations or energies that match with a planet, zodiac sign, element, or Sephirah.

## Earth Deities

As you continue in your studies, you should cross reference these principles across cultures and systems to tease out more juice. Therefore, here are different deities who represent the earth element

- Geb (or Seb) - the Egyptian earth god, father of Osiris, Isis, Nephthys and Set.
- Tammuz (or Dumuzi) - the Assyro-Babylonian earth and harvest god, and lover of Ishtar. He is the male version of Persephone for when he suddenly died in his prime, Ishtar went down to save him but he had to return every half of the year to the underworld, whence the seasons.
- Gaea - the Greek earth goddess, and much like Geb, her body is the land itself. Along with the sky god Uranus, she gave birth to the Titans, the first race.

To close, other Greek deities associated with the earth element: Cybele, Attis, Demeter, Persephone.
