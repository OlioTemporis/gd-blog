This Lecture was originally given in the Philosophus Grade of the Golden Dawn by Mathers and later in the Zelator Grade of the Stella Matutina. We have chosen to retain it in the Zelator Grade because of its relevance not only to the Table of Shewbread diagram but also to the ancient Hebrew Tabernacle in the Wilderness, which plays such an important role in the Zelator ritual of self-initiation.
