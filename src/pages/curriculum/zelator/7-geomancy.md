Divination is the means by which we are able to come into contact with spirits, thereby attaining knowledge, whether for the past, present, or future. It also trains our astral faculties.

There are many ways to perform a divination. It may be as simple as tossing a consecrated coin for a yes or no answer, or rolling dice for an even/odd answer.

As a Zelator, you'll be learning how to do divination with Geomancy first. Yet it is advised to work with Greer's book _The Art and Practice of Geomancy_ on the subject instead of using the Golden Dawn's material, since scholarship has greatly progressed (yet be aware of the associations that the Tetragrams have in the overall GD system, e.g. the King of Disks is associated with the Tetragram Conjunctio). You can also see the article 'Mysteria Geomantica: Teachings in the Art of Geomany' within the first book of _The Golden Dawn Journal_.

Divination via Geomancy requires making contact with a Geomantic Spirit or _Genius_. Before a reading, the diviner selects one of the ruling Spirits of the Planetary energies, the suitable one for the type of question. Take care to phrase your question carefully because the answer will reflect the most literal form of the question. Notice that in the chart below that the Genii match with the ruling planet's spirit.

As you can see, each Tetragram is associated with a Zodiac sign. The GD system further aligns each one with a court card from the Tarot, to further add another layer to what you can get out of a reading.

1. Acquisitio (acquiring things: resources, benefits, desires, honors, and knowledge. generally positive in almost all situations—except where loss is desired.) - King of Wands
2. Amissio (bad for any effort for personal gain, but good for leaving or giving up something, like your heart in a Venusian sense) - Prince of Disks
3. Albus (beneficial for profitable ventures and new starts and good for most things involving planning and mental discipline.) - King of Swords
4. Rubeus (an extremely bad glyph of passion and anger. It represents an upended glass from which all is lost; its inverted nature indicates good in the evil and evil within good. This has some resonance that this Knight/Prince has great powers for extremes, both good and bad, but is sometimes more attracted to the supremacy that evil wisdom promises.) - Prince of Cups
5. Puella (indicative of peace and passive response, and usually it is positive, especially in relation to situations involving women.) - Queen of Swords
6. Puer (generally an unfavorable sign, indicating carelessness, violence, puerility yet good questions pertaining to love and war) - Queen of Wands
7. Laetitia (joy, happiness, hope fufilled, rising above sorrows) - King of Cups
8. Tristitia (usually unwelcome due to its association with mourning, but it can be beneficial for things dealing with Saturn’s themes of stability and structure.) - Prince of Swords
9. Caput Draconis (a good figure. An entrance, going in, coming to, generally good news in matters of gain, but mainly neutral and influenced by whatever surrounds) - Princess of Disks
10. Cauda Draconis (only considered good for bringing releases and completions; it has absorbed all and is letting go. It’s contradictory for it brings evil to good, yet good to evil. Generally speaking, it is a challenge, for it heralds disruptions.) - Princess of Wands
11. Populus (The assembly of people affects the outcome of the situation: the figure reflects what it is paired with, bringing favor to the favorable and disfavor to the unfavorable.) - Queen of Cups
12. Via (the figure of four single dots in a line represents a path taken. More than any other figure it indicates change, an action, or a transformation. It’s a benign figure unless change is undesirable.) - Princess of Cups
13. Conjunctio (neutral in influence, though beneficial for connection. Good remains good and evil negative; it conjoins with whatever surrounds it.) - King of Disks
14. Carcer (an evil figure representing prison, restriction, capture, delay) - Queen of Disks
15. Fortuna Major (divine assistance, very good for starting new ventures and contests) - Prince of Wands
16. Fortuna Minor (aid that comes from outside help. It is positive in situations that can be quickly resolved.) - Princess of Swords

The rest of the chapter goes into extreme detail into pulling off a Geomantic operation.
