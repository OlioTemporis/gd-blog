The Alchemist operates on the following axioms:

1. Creation has a divine origin, the One. Therefore all is One.
2. That which is or is reified is under the Law of Polarity or Duality.
3. That which is reified (be it mineral, plant, or animal) has three main components: Spirit (Mercury), Soul (Sulphur), Body (Salt).
4. All alchemical operations (whether physical or spiritual) consist of three main steps: Separation (Aleph, Air, The Fool), Purification (Shin, Fire, Judgement), and Cohobation (Mem, Water, The Hanged Man).
5. All matter is composed of the four Elements of Fire (thermal energy), Water (liquid), Air (gas), and Earth (solid). Therefore, your knowledge of them is paramount.
6. There is a fifth element within all of the four but not a part of them known as Spirit, the philosphic Mercury (Quicksilver).
7. Everything moves towards its destined, perfected state, or in Aristotelian terms its Telos, or in Thelemic terms its True Will.

The four major stages of alchemical transmutation are represented by the following colors:

1. Black (prima materia)
2. White (minor work, first transmutation, quicksilver)
3. Red (sulphur, passion)
4. Gold (spiritual purity)

The _Tria Principia Naturae_ are the following:

1. Sulfur (Soul, Fire) - the dynamic, expansive, unifying, and fiery principle. Sulphur is extracted from Mercury during distillation and then dissolved back into it.
2. Salt (Body, Earth) - the principle of substance, form, weight. Salt acts as the container for both Sulfur and Mercury
3. Mercury (Spirit, Unicorn, Water) - aka 'Quicksilver', the watery, feminine principle that is related to consciousness. Mercury is the Spirit within all matter and is symbolic of the act of transmutation, for by it is matter transformation in operations. As Spirit, Mercury mediates between Salt (the body) and Sulphur (the soul). Mercury has two states (both liquid): the first is volatile, prior to having its Sulphur extracted; the second is fixed, after its Sulphur has been returned. This second stage is called 'the Secret Fire' or 'Prepared Mercury'.

The Alchemical elements:

1. Terra - life-essence, the product of Nature.
2. Aqua - eternal life through the four-fold division of the Universe.
3. Aer - power through a connection with the Quintessence, Spirit.
4. Ignis - the transformative agent, the transmutation of matter.

The Planetary Metals (note, an alchemist views metals, aka minerals, as living just like plants or animals and his goal is to accelerate its Telos by means of Alchemy):

1. Saturn = Lead (Plumbum)
2. Jupiter = Tin (Stannum)
3. Mars = Iron (Ferrum), Steel
4. Sol = Gold (Aurum), also represents the _Conjunctio Solis et Luna_ or ἱερὸς γάμος, which is glyphed by the Hermaphrodite.
5. Venus = Copper (Cuprum), Brass
6. Mercury = Quicksilver (Argentum Vivum)
7. Luna = Silver (Argentum)

Here are some equivalents of the things discussed in Alchemical Jargon:

- Mercury = Acetum Philosophorum (a synonym for 'virgin's milk' or 'Secret Fire'), Aes Hermetis, Ansir, Aqua Permanens, Dog, Dog & Wolf
- Aqua Vitae, Gluten, Lac Virginis, Lily = _kalas_, Moonjuice
- Bath of Venus, Cauldron, Kettle, Cup, Chalice, Fountain = Kteis
- Blood of the Red Lion = σπέρμα
- Book = the Universe
- Bow = the combination of masculine and feminine issue, the crescent of Luna being feminine, and the launching of the arrow, masculine.
- Masculine principle = Cypress (as phallus), Emperor, Father, Forge (the G on the FM apron), Goat, Ignis Leonis, Sulfur, Red Man
- Green Lion = the raw and unpurified energies in nature, that which must be sought in the Prima Materia, the beginning of the Great Work (Separation, Aleph, The Fool)
