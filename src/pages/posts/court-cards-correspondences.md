- 51. THE AROUSING (SHOCK, THUNDER) (KNIGHT OF WANDS) - Boo! Scared you didn’t it? It scared everyone else too! Ha ha. That’s only natural. When you’ve got your poop together, you should never really be afraid. The trigram of thunder or fire is twice repeated. It’s also called the “arousing,” the “shocking,” the “thunderclap,” and—especially appropriate for the primal yod—the beginning of movement. The motion may be startling, but it leads to success. One goes forward resolutely with both apprehension and confidence.

QUEEN OF WANDS - Adaptability, steady force applied to an object, steady rule, great attractive power, power of command, yet liked. Kind and generous when not opposed. If ill-dignified, obstinate, revengeful, domineering, tyrannical, and apt to turn against another without a cause.

- 54. THE MARRYING MAIDEN (KNIGHT OF CUPS) - Watch your step. You’re pretty damned low on this totem pole. You won’t be able to force anything.

- 41. DECREASE (PRINCESS OF CUPS) - A downturn in the economy—less stuff—less time—less energy. Don’t get mad. Become simpler. Make it an art form. a becalming or decline that is natural after a period of flowering. It doesn’t necessarily mean loss but rather a surrender, diminishing the passions of the lower self in order to increase the higher instinct, a sacrifice that is beneficial if sincere.

KNIGHT OF SWORDS - He is active, clever, subtle, fierce, delicate, courageous, skillful, but inclined to domineer. Also to overvalue small things, unless well-dignified. If ill-dignified, deceitful, tyrannical, and crafty.

- 32. DURATION (KNIGHT OF SWORDS) - Marriage. The courtship is over. The man gets off his knees (the woman is still in control). Living force and energy—enduring because it is flexible—moving yet stable like the stars. The trigrams of thunder above wind, meaning “enduring” or “duration.” It’s something that would benefit Gemini to work on: commitment and consistency, a message repeated by the King/Knight’s shadow decan Taurus III. By maintaining constancy in the face of change and perseverance in what is right, good fortune follows.

QUEEN OF SWORDS - Intensely perceptive, keen observation, subtle, quick and confident; often persevering, accurate in superficial things, graceful, fond of dancing and balancing. If ill-dignified, cruel, sly, deceitful, unreliable, though with a good exterior.

Two trigrams of 'wind' or 'air'. Through service and complaisance, one has a gradual lasting influence on others. Just as gentle winds over time (Saturn’s domain) can erode a mountain, constancy of ideals can wear down any obstacle.

- 18. WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED (DECAY) (PRINCESS OF SWORDS)- What somebody ruined, somebody can fix. Study the cause. Fix it. Then watch it for a while to make sure it works. mountain over wind. The meanings involve remedying and renovation, repairing what has been corrupted and destroying degeneration.

KNIGHT OF DISKS -Unless very well-dignified he is heavy, dull, and material. Laborious, clever, and patient in material matters. If ill-dignified, he is avaricious, grasping, dull, jealous; not very courageous, unless assisted by other symbols.

- 62. PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL (KNIGHT OF DISKS) - Keep your expectations low. Don’t expect big things to come out of this. Concentrate on the little stuff. Keep it simple and unpretentious. Do the correct thing in the correct way at the correct time. 'Thunder over mountain' is about attempting the small and avoiding the great. Small powers get by, just as a small bird succeeds if it does not attempt to rise too high. It also means an excess of small things, such as the overattention to detail commonly attributed to Virgo.

QUEEN OF DISKS - She is impetuous, kind, timid, rather charming, greathearted, intelligent, melancholy, truthful, yet of many moods. If ill-dignified, she is undecided, capricious, changeable, foolish.

- 31. INFLUENCE (WOOING) (QUEEN OF DISKS) - Mutual attraction. Courtship, not seduction. The man’s on his knees, but the woman is in control. Be happy to give people your advice, but don’t act like a know-it-all. 'Lake over mountain' has significations of wooing, inviting, attraction, and the coming together of opposites. Persistence, perseverance, and being willing to receive others with openness and humility brings fulfillment. One should go forward methodically and consistently to obtain influence.

PRINCE OF DISKS - Increase of matter. Increases good or evil, solidifies; practically applies things. Steady, reliable. If ill-dignified, he is selfish, animal and material, stupid. In either case slow to anger, but furious if roused.

- 53. DEVELOPMENT (GRADUAL PROGRESS) (PRINCE OF DISKS) - Slow but sure. No need to be hasty. Be patient. Proceed gradually, one step at a time. Progress remains stable and strong by growing slowly. 'Wind over mountain'. Gradual progress is made as one perseveres, working slowly and with stability. An acorn eventually grows into a mighty oak, and the slower it grows, the stronger it becomes.

PRINCESS OF DISKS - She is generous, kind, diligent, benevolent, careful, courageous, persevering, pitiful. If ill-dignified, she is wasteful and prodigal.

- 52. KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN (PRINCESS OF DISKS) - Find a quiet place away from people and noises. Forget your body for a while. Go inside and meet yourself. Keep focused on the present situation. Thinking beyond that will only bum you out and waste your time. 'Mountain over mountain' has connotations of silence, calm, and rest after a long journey, achieving tranquility in relation to the entirety of life.

## Court Cards + Geomantic Figures + I Ching

### Water Family

</figure>

A beautiful youthful winged warrior, with flying hair, riding upon a white horse, which latter is not winged. His general equipment is similar to that of the Knight of Wands, but upon his helmet, cuirass, and buskins is a peacock with opened wings. He holds a cup in his hand, bearing the sigil of the scale. Beneath his horse’s feet is the sea. From the cup issues a crab.

Graceful, poetic, Venusian, indolent, but enthusiastic if roused. Ill-dignified, he is sensual, idle, and untruthful. He rules the heavens from above twentieth degree of Aquarius to twentieth degree of Pisces including the greater part of Pegasus.

**King Cups**, The Lord of the Waves and the Waters; King of the Hosts of the Sea. CREATIVE FORCE. Energy that is swift but not enduring. Creative energy which gives rise to multiple forms. Energy like that of a sudden rain or flashflood. The King/Knight of Cups is mainly mutable water sign Pisces, ruled by Jupiter and Neptune. Pisces is a true believer and goes forth with faith in something higher. The intent is to transcend. A personification of the force which motivates the currents of the unconscious mental world symbolized by Water.

- Laetitia ( ♃ - ♓ ). The figure is shaped like an archway or rainbow and points upward to something higher. It is a literally buoyant figure that brings happiness, delight, and the ability to rise above sorrows.

- represents upward movement of all kinds, from high hopes to the uprooting of fixed conditions. It is favorable in almost all questions except for those in which secrecy is desired. In it fire alone is active, and air, water, and earth are passive.

- Hexagram 54 Kwei Mei (Marrying Maiden). It is about acceptance of what cannot be changed and following propriety. One adapts to circumstances and transforms. There are possible pitfalls: mistakes made at the beginning of a situation will have to be lived with. One must use discrimination when setting forth on a path.

<figure class="max-w-md">

</figure>

A very beautiful fair woman like a crowned queen, seated upon a throne, beneath which is flowing water, wherein lotuses are seen. Her general dress is similar to that of the Queen of Wands, but upon her crown, cuirass, and buskins is seen an ibis with opened wings, and beside her is the same bird, whereon her hand rests. She holds a cup, wherefrom a crayfish issues. Her face is dreamy. She holds a lotus in the hand upon the ibis.

She is imaginative, poetic, kind, yet not willing to take much trouble for another. Coquettish, good-natured, underneath a dreamy appearance. Imagination stronger than feeling. Very much affected by other influences, and therefore more dependent upon good or ill-dignity than upon most other symbols. She rules from twentieth degree of Gemini to twentieth degree of Cancer.

**Queen Cups**, Queen of the Thrones of the Waters. REFLECTIVE FORCE. Reflective force, which mirrors the surrounding energy. Transmitting force which casts back the nearby influences while remaining unaffected. An energy conduit. Energy like that of a clear still pool. Cancer (the Crayfish), being Cardinal Water, is maternal, nurturing, and protective. Cancer is ruled by the Moon (Ibis, for Thoth the Moon God). The sky’s great reflector has long been an emblem of the Great Mother goddesses. This lunar quality also gives her psychic ability, popular favor, fruitfulness, and the ability to reflect the nature of those who behold her just as the moon mirrors the light of the sun. Cancer feels deeply, and wants to support and nourish those she cares about.

- Populus ( ☽ - ♋ ), complement of Via (Princess of Cups). All of the possible places are filled, as if one is looking down upon a crowd. The assembly of people affects the outcome of the situation: the figure reflects what it is paired with, bringing favor to the favorable and disfavor to the unfavorable.

General attire like King of Wands. Beneath his chariot is the calm and stagnant water of a lake. His scale armour resembles feathers more than scales.

destructive. Energy like that of steam or mist. The magnetism of fixed water sign Scorpio underlies his calm visage.

- Rubeus ( ♂ - ♏ ), an extremely bad glyph of passion and anger. It represents an upended glass from which all is lost; its inverted nature indicates good in the evil and evil within good. This has some resonance that this Knight/Prince has great powers for extremes, both good and bad, but is sometimes more attracted to the supremacy that evil wisdom promises.

- Via ( ☽ - ♋ - Water), the complement to that of her mother, the Queen (Populus). Via means “the way,” and the figure of four single dots in a line represents a path taken. More than any other figure it indicates change, an action, or a transformation. It’s a benign figure unless change is undesirable.

- represents change, movement, transition, solitude—the departure from the collective and the beginning of individuality. In its effects on other figures it is an unfavorable influence, but it is favorable for journeys and for change of any kind. In it all four elements are active.

- Hexagram 41 Sun (Diminution), 'mountain over lake', It shows the mountain being eroded by the lake below it so that the mountain eventually falls into it and as a result of this shows decrease or loss.

</figure>

A winged king with a winged crown, seated in a chariot drawn by arch fays, archons, or arch fairies, represented as winged youths very slightly draped, with butterfly wings, heads encircled with a fillet with pentagrams thereon, and holding wands surmounted by pentagram-shaped stars.

- Tristitia ( ♄ - ♒ ). It resembles a stake being driven into the ground. It’s usually unwelcome due to its association with mourning, but it can be beneficial for things dealing with Saturn’s themes of stability and structure.

- represents downward movement of all kinds, from low spirits to the establishment of firm foundations. It is unfavorable in most questions but favorable when stability or secrecy are desired or when planting crops. In it earth alone is active, and fire, air, and water are passive.

- Hexagram 57 Sun (Wind Gently Penetrating), very opaque, flexible yet penetrating, the sophist who can juggle any argument and drop it for a new one on a whim.

<figure class="max-w-md">
  <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-base" src="https://i.ibb.co/nqSRmXtc/princess-swords.png" alt="princess swords">

- Fortuna Minor ( ☉ - ♌ - Air), which has to do with the opposite sign on the axis, Leo, and the sun in southern declinations. The glyph is supposed to represent beams of light. This is the “lesser fortune”: aid that comes from outside help. It is positive in situations that can be quickly resolved.

- represents influence, swiftness, subtlety, cleverness, and success through another’s help or through circumstances rather than through one’s own power. It is favorable for all questions in which swiftness is needed. In it fire and air are active, and water and earth are passive.

- Hexagram 18 Ku (Troubles), 'mountain over wind', The Combination of the Two Trigrams is a strong one on top of a weak one which shows a lack of growth due to the product being spoiled.

### Earth Family

<figure class="max-w-md">
  <img class="h-auto max-w-full rounded-base" src="https://i.ibb.co/BKdYtrpw/king-disks.png" alt="King disks">
</figure>

Energy like that of a fertile mountain slop. As fire of earth, solar energy (Will) applied to material things. Hard-working Virgo energy applied meticulously, overseeing large-scale farm operations.

- represents connection, interaction, conflict, and generally all the modes by which one existence comes into relation with another. It is favorable with favorable figures and unfavorable with unfavorable ones, and it tells of the return of things that have been lost. In it air and water are active, and fire and earth are passive.

- Hexagram 62 Hsiao Kwo (Small Powers), 'thunder over mountain' or 'movement over stillness'. To the Chinese sages, the shape of the figure gave the idea of a bird. The meaning is, accordingly, modified by human influence of the more frivolous and irresponsible kind, Shakespeare's “little wanton harlotry”, the French cynic's “Souvent femme vane”, and the fickle mob of Coriolanus; indeed, of History itself.

**Queen Disks**, Queen of the Thrones of Earth; Queen of Gnomes. REGENERATIVE FORCE. Receptive, germinating force which carries out the process of regeneration. Energy like that of a desert receiving a nourishing rain. Her shadow decan is Sagittarius III, the sign ruled by Jupiter but oppressed by Saturn’s decan and sephira association. Falling into a controlling role and the autocratic behaviors of Oppression will undermine her gift for gestation. Otherwise, hardworking, stable, and conservative Capricorn energy climbing and pushing to the top.
